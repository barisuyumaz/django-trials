# How it works?
* After you download the 'django-ders-serisi-sadikturan' file, open it on VsCode.
* The program will work on a Virtual Environment, that's why you should create a Virtual Environment in next to created blogapp Django file.
  * When you in 'django-ders-serisi-sadikturan' folder in Terminal, write 'python -m venv myenv' (optionally you can change the name of 'myenv')
  * Now you have a venv. You should active it: Go to myenv\Scripts and write './activate' . You are in a Virtual Environment now!
  * Write 'pip freeze' and you will see that you have only default Python libraries, you should install Django lib.
  * Write 'pip install Django==4.0.3'. You have installed Django lib in your venv successfully.
  * Go back to your directory and run your Django Project.
* Write 'cd' .. and 'cd' .. again. Then 'cd blogapp' (to get in our django project).
* Write 'python manage.py runserver' to run our project. It will display you a link which starts like 127.0...
* Now we have reached our project!
